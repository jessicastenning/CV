## Jessica Stenning

Full stack developer and Makers Academy graduate.

Having graduated from the University of Bath, I secured a role with PwC. After 2 years working in financial services and simultaneously completing my chartered accountancy exams, I decided that a career in finance + corporate business doesn't = happy Jess.

I'm looking for a developer role where I can grow my programming knowledge and contribute to an exciting team, where I'm challenged intellectually and surrounded by peers passionate about their work - preferably within a consultancy environment.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

At PwC my primary role was as a relationship manager; using my technical knowledge to understand complex legislation and scenarios, and communicate solutions with clarity to clients with little tax knowledge.

I'd regularly work with colleagues at a variety of seniorities, up to partner level, and my confidence communicating has provided me with multiple opportunities professionally and otherwise.

Additional responsibilities included:
- Training lead for internal training sessions delivered to first year associates
- Business unit NextGen representative - a company-wide network for employees below manager grade, organising networking events and monthly socials

#### Fast learner

- I'm confident in my ability to pick up new concepts quickly; I find the prospect of a big learning curve far more exciting than it is daunting  
- My previous role depended on my ability to continuously get to grips with new technical concepts via my accounting exams as well as shifting legislation
- I completed a 6 month secondment to another department where I was expected to be up to speed and chargeable after my first week with the team

#### Thrives under pressure
